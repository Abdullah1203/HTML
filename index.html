        <p><b>Food 1: Kacchi Biriyani</b></p>
        <p>
          
          ‘Kacchi’ means ‘raw’ in English. Unlike most other types of Biriyani,
          the meat used in this dish is first marinated with spices and placed
          at the bottom of the cooking pot uncooked. The rice, which is first
          washed and then mixed with spices, is added on top, before the meat
          and rice are cooked together. Sometimes potato is added to the mix to
          add body to the dish.

        <p><b>Food 2: Shorshe Ilish (Hilsa Fish with Mustard Curry)</b></p>
        <p>
          Shorshe Ilish is a dish consisting of hilsa
          fish cooked in savory mustard gravy, commonly served with white rice
          for a hearty, must-try meal. The mustard is cooked with various
          spices, giving it plenty of heat and kick. Once the mustard reaches a
          gravy-like consistency, the hilsa fish is added and cooked until
          tender. This is a dish that bursts with flavor, and it is beloved
          across the country.

        <p><b>Food 3: Beef Kala Bhuna</b></p>
        <p>
          Kala Bhuna gets its name from its appearance, as 'kala' means 'black'. The meat - which can be beef or mutton - is cooked with a long list of traditional spices and yogurt. It is cooked for much longer than in other curries, which gives the meat a blackish hue. It also tastes different than regular beef curry.

        <p><b>Food 4: Sheek Kebab with Naan</b></p>
        <p>
          Roshogolla is a simple, wholesome dish. It is made from cottage cheese, which is strained from fresh milk and kneaded until soft. The cheese is pressed and rolled into balls, then boiled in sugar syrup until fluffy and spongy. Roshogolla can be eaten hot, fresh off the stove, or stored in the refrigerator and eaten as a chilled dessert.
